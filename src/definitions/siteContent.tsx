					Well, <span className='lead font-weight-bold'>I'm selfish!</span> I have worked with different technologies over
					the past two years ranging from Embedded Systems to Full stack Web Development. But working for Five.ai's Deep Learning team
					is a different kind of beast. Creating truly autonomous vehicles that have the potential to bring about a
					paradigm shift in how we commute is both exciting and scary. Mostly exciting though. By working for Five.ai,
					Iâ€™ll directly improve my life along with the lives of millions of others. Everybody wins!
